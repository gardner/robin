# robin anti-spam auto-vote

This anti-spam robot works differently than the others currently available. It looks at each message and counts the number of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and non-word characters (e.g. :poop: )
You can tweak the allowed ratios of uppercase to lowercase and percentage of non-word characters.
